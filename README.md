# go-utilities
A collection of opiniated functions I use to make my work building routine background services a little easier.

## Documentation
1. This is at alpha stage. Lots of bugs, untested code and an evolving list of features that are still in development.
2. I have a [blog post explaining my motivation behind creating this library]()

## Installation
